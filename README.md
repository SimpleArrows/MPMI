This program will help you install mods that require xtbls in both the misc and table VPPs to be edited. 

You can use this program to create MP mods. In order to play with people with this mod, you will need the other players to also install it! It is recommended that you backup any files such as your misc and table VPPs before installing any mod with this tool. However, I've also provided the original VPPs in a folder incase you mess up and didn't back them up!

If you are to make MP mods with this tool, keep in mind that some xtbl files in table and misc are different from eachother. You'll have to find out which files are different and edit them correctly.

This installer is still in development, if you come across any bugs please DM me on Discord (Arrows#5699) or make an issue in the second tab of this GitHub!
